               We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices
               gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable,
               Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:

                         A way out west there was a fella,
                         fella I want to tell you about, fella
                         by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At
                         least, that was the handle his lovin'
                         parents gave him, but he never had
                         much use for it himself.  This
                         Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.
                         Now, Dude, that's a name no one would
                         self-apply where I come from.  But
                         then, there was a lot about the Dude
                         that didn't make a whole lot of sense
                         to me.  And a lot about where he
                         lived, like- wise.  But then again,
                         maybe that's why I found the place
                         s'durned innarestin'.

                         exactly, but I'll allow as there are
                         some nice folks there.  'Course, I

<p>

               It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking
               in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the
               dairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed
               manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.
</p>

<p>

               He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their
               expiration dates.

                         Now this story I'm about to unfold
                         took place back in the early nineties--
                         just about the time of our conflict
                         with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I

               The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of
               milk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.

</p>

<p>

               She waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to
               her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with
               helicopter rotors spinning behind him.

               The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at
               the little customer's lectern.  Milk beads his mustache.

               The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and

               The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.
               Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and
               cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.
               The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night.

               After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.

<h2><a href='#4' name='4'>DUDE'S HOUSE</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow
               court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small
               leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the
               grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a href='#5' name='5'>INSIDE</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               The Dude enters and flicks on a light.
</p>

<p>

               His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.
               We track with him as he is rushed through the living room,
               his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.
               Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece
               of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a
               hole.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small
               bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of
               doorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper
               bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet
               rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the
               floor.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude blows bubbles.

               Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and
               gasps for air.
</p>

<p>

<b>VOICE</b>
<blockquote>
                         Where's the money, Lebowski!

               His head is plunged back into the toilet.

                         Treehorn.

               The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and
               flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against
               the toilet.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.
</p>

<p>

               Looming over him is a strapping blond man.
</p>

<p>

               Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly
               and walks over to a rug.

               The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.  He pulls out a
               bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious
               native.

               Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins
               flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes,
               sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a
               ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.
</p>

<p>

               The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant
               jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.
</p>

<p>

               A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail

               We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man
               nursing a large plastic cup of Bud.  He has dark worried
               eyes and a goatee.  Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.
               He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves
               cut off over an old bowling shirt.  This is Walter.  He
               squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he

               We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver

               Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed
               Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI
               ACHIEVER?  Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we
               realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the
               display is mirrored.
</p>

<p>

               We hear the door open and the whine of a motor.  The Dude,
               wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look.
</p>

<p>

               So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.  He
               wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.
</p>

<p>

               Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized
               wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.
</p>

<p>

<b>LEBOWSKI</b>
<blockquote>

                         busy so what can I do for you?
</blockquote>

               He wheels himself behind a desk.  The Dude sits facing him
               as Brandt withdraws.

<h2><a href='#32' name='32'>DUDE'S BUNGALOW</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug.
               His eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking
               tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an
               intermittent clatter.
</p>

<p>

               In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE
               BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall
               rumbling down the lane.  On its impact with the pins, the
               Dude opens his eyes.
</p>

<p>

               He screams.
</p>

<p>

               A blonde woman looms over him.  Next to  her a  young man
               in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards
               the carrier.
</p>

<p>

               The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head
               thunking back onto the rug.
</p>

<p>

               A million stars explode against a field of black.  We hear
               the "La-la-la-la" of The Man in Me.
</p>

<p>

               The black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug.
               The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of
               Los  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in
               front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his
               bowling shirt. He looks up.
</p>

<p>

               Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the
               Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.  She is outpacing
               us, growing smaller.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices
               that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.
               His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic
               implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its
               weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He
               is falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down
               toward the city, dragged by the ball.
</p>

<p>

               A  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us
               out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.  Led by
               the bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in
               black.
</p>

<p>

               We hear a distant rumble, like thunder.  Dull reflections
               materialize in the darkness.  They are glints off the shiny
               surface of an oncoming bowling ball.
</p>

<p>

               We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of
               a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being
               regurgitated up at us, overtaking us.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass
               rolling a huge shadow across his face.
</p>

<p>

               The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward
               us --finger holes.
</p>

<p>

               The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing
               us once again in black..
</p>

<p>

               The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a
               bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in
               the thumbhole of the rolling ball.
</p>

<p>

               We see the receding bowler spinning away.  It is the blonde
               woman, performing her follow-through.
</p>

<p>

               Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and
               away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor;
               ceiling; approaching pins; again and again.
</p>

<p>

               We hit the pins and clatter into blackness.  We hear pins
               spin, hit each other and drop.
</p>

<p>

               We hear an irritating, insistent beeping.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a href='#33' name='33'>FADE IN</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               We are close on the Dude, upside down.  As the picture fades
               in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint.
               They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is
               now askew, with one arm off his ear.
</p>

<p>

               As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put
               him right side around.  His head is now resting against
               hardwood floor, not rug.
</p>

<p>

<blockquote>

               He  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the
               red   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is
               blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a href='#34' name='34'>WIDE ON THE ROOM</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is
               in place. The rug is gone.
</p>

<p>

               The  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue.
               The beeps continue.
</p>

<p>

               The phone starts to jangle.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a href='#35' name='35'>TRACK</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               We  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway.
               Again  there is a  distant  aria.    Brandt  throws  out a
               wrist to  look at  his watch.
</p>

<p>

                         They were very clear on that: one

               They have reached the little desk outside of the big
               Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key
               and takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude
               along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case.

<h2><a href='#36' name='36'>DUDE'S CAR</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through
               the front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter
               standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK
               SECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the
               fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look
               oddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape
               bundled in brown wrapping paper.
</p>

<p>

               The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door
               and hands in the briefcase.

<h2><a href='#48' name='48'>TRACKING FORWARD</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               We are moving through the open living area of a large downtown
               L.A. loft.  A huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing
               industrial lights, dominates one wall.  The furnishings  are
               spare  given the space.  On the floor is the Dude's brilliant
               rug.
</p>

<p>

               We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball.  The Dude,
               standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky
               depths of the cavernous space.
</p>

<p>

               Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head.
               As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass.
</p>

<p>

               We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended
               from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the
               floor.  She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush
               in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps.  Two
               young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers
               reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track
               and haul it back for another push.

               The  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling.   She  is naked
               except for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts
               and wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix

<p>

               A dripping noise.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint
               pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head.
</p>

<p>

               We hear the phone ringing in the other roam.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the
               soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub.
</p>

<p>

               After the Dude's outgoing message we hear:
</p>

<p>

<blockquote>

               The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds, as of

<p>

<b>DUDE</b>
<blockquote>
                         Hunh?

               He looks blearily at the open doorway.
</p>

<p>

               A tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is
               striding across the living room towards the bathroom.
</p>

<p>

<b>DUDE</b>
<blockquote>

               The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the
               cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light.  Two other
               men are entering behind him.
</p>

<p>

               The room is dark now except for spill from the living room;
               the men are backlit shapes.
</p>

<p>

               One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small
               animal skitters excitedly about the floor.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal.

<blockquote>

               The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it,
               screaming, into the bathtub.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude screams.
</p>

<p>

               The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a
               frenzy of fearful aggression.
</p>

<p>

<blockquote>

               The Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to
               hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his
               head and squishes him back into the water.
</p>

<p>

               He scoops the marmot out of the water.  It shakes itself
               off, spraying the Dude.

               The marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking
               itself and convulsing in little sneezes.

               They have reached the Dude's car.  The  driver's side

               The Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will
               not go; he bellows through the glass:

               The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman
               rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by

               His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off.  Leaking
               tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of
               "Comin' Up Around the Bend."
</p>

<p>

               Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso,
               a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back.  After a
               moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame.  His
               hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the
               Dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.

<h2><a href='#74' name='74'>DUDE'S CAR</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               The Dude is driving home.  A Creedence tape plays.  The Dude
               is sucking down a joint.  He glances at the rear-view mirror--
               and, noticing something, looks again.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a href='#75' name='75'>HIS POV</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               A Volkswagon bug is following, a lone fat man driving.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a href='#76' name='76'>THE DUDE</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint
               between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it
               out the driver's window--except that the window is not open.
               The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering
               sparks.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a href='#77' name='77'>DUDE'S CROTCH</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs.
               The Dude screams.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a href='#78' name='78'>THE STREET</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off
               to, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes
               to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone
               poll.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a href='#79' name='79'>INSIDE THE CAR</a></h2>

<p>

               The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open,
               and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which
               also won't open.

               But he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from
               the lit butt.  He looks around for it.

               Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion
               and back cushion.

               He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions.
               There is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper
               sticking out from between the cushions.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude pulls it out.
</p>

<p>

               It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and
               dripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right-
               hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that,
               Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled "The Louisiana
               Purchase."  In red ink is a large circled D and some
               handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled
               in red throughout.

               There is a rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and
               nudges the Dude.  At the other end of the living room a man
               lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its
               midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble.
               It is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct
               hisses in and out.

               Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out

<blockquote>
                         All right, Plan B.  You might want

               He is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to

               Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like

               He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes
               out a tire iron.

               Lights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs

               A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over

</p>

<p>

               We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as
               it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved-
               in windows.

<p>

               The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the

               As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four
               into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.

               He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair
               that stands nearby.

               He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into
               place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced
               against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when
               the door is opened--outwards.  The chair clatters to the
               floor.

<p>

               Out of the blackness something is falling toward us.  It is
               a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her
               mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy.  She is topless.
               She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a
               beat reappears, rising into the night sky.

<p>

               A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried
               hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual
               attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in

               It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing
               kerosene heaters.  1960's mainstream jazz, of the Mancini-
               Brubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach'.
</p>

<p>

               In long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears
               into darkness, descends into light, rises again.
</p>

<p>

               A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach
               light.  He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants
               and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the
               neck.  Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and
               disappears.

</p>

<p>

               The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked
               by a pair of  bowling balls.   The  bending bass sound turns
               into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's
               "Just Dropped In."
</p>

<p>

               The Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable
               repairman.  The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light
               as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley.
</p>

<p>

               In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing
               operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.  She wears an
               armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails,
               and holds a trident.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps
               her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball.
</p>

<p>

               The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini-
               skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs
               turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the
               end.
</p>

<p>

               But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their
               legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane,
               the tools from his utility belt swinging free.  He is face
               down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides.
</p>

<p>

               His point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little
               ball-guide arrows zipping by.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so
               that he is now gliding along the lane face-up.
</p>

<p>

               Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing
               chorines.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so
               that he is once again gliding face-down.  He looks forward
               and his forward momentum blows back his hair.
</p>

<p>

               Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs,
               are the approaching pins.  We hit the pins, scattering them,
               and rush on into black.
</p>

<p>

               A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless
               woman, squealing, her legs kicking.
</p>

<p>

               As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three
               men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool
               of light.  It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding
               oversized shears which they menacingly scissor.
</p>

<p>

               The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the
               advancing Germans.  He turns and runs, fists pumping.
</p>

<p>

               The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of
               car-bys.  The field of black is punctured by headlights.
               The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific
               Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring.
</p>

<p>

               With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with
               flashing gumballs pulls up.
</p>

<p>

<h2><a href='#105' name='105'>SQUAD CAR</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the
               motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded:
</p>

</blockquote>

<h2><a href='#106' name='106'>CHIEF'S OFFICE</a></h2>
</p>

<p>

               The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces
               off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair.
</p>

<p>

               His wallet is tossed onto the desk.
</p>

<p>

               The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through
               it with disgusted incredulity.

               The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude.  It
               hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee
               splashing everywhere.
</p>

<p>

               The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.

               He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts

               whines and coughs; no start.

               hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless

               kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping.  Franz gives
               a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his

<p>

<h2><a href='#139' name='139'>WALTER</a></h2>

               His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear.  Dieter draws his
               saber against Walter's side, drawing blood.
</p>

<p>

               Walter doesn't react to the wound.  Growling as Dieter

</p>

<p>

               As he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the  boom box swings into
               frame to smash him in the face.  Its volume shoots up.
</p>

<p>

               Walter bashes him a few more times over the head.  The music
               screeches to static, then quiet.  Laid out now, Franz too is
               quiet.

               He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit
               halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head
               pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence.
               The Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a
               mortician's smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards
               Donnelly, pointing.

               It is a high, wind-swept bluff.  Walter and the Dude walk
               towards the lip of the bluff.  Parked in the background is
               one lonely car, Walter's.

               Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic

                         He was a man who loved the outdoors,
                         and bowling, and as a surfer explored
                         the beaches of southern California
                         from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he

                         of his generation, before his time.
                         In your wisdom you took him, Lord.
                         As you took so many bright flowering

                         and Hill 364.  These young men gave

               The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing
               just to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands,
